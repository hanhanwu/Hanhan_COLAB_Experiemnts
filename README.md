Experiements using Google COLAB

## About Google COLab
* It's a convenient tool to use ipython in the cloud. Libraries such as tensorflow, pytorch, keras, etc. are all built in. It also supports team collaboration by sharing the ipython notebook. You can also use free GPU. Saved ipython can also connect to your GitHub or Gist as a saved file too. The user experience is very smooth.
* [How to use COLAB with Free GPU][1]
* To exit playground mode, you need to open the notebook through your google drive.
